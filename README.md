# Sliced Kernelized Stein Discrepancy + Active Slices for Sliced Stein Discrepancy

This repo implemented the main experiments for the following papers:
* [Sliced Kernelized Stein Discrepancy](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=t0TaKv0Gx6Z) by [Wenbo Gong](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=wenbo-gong), [Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/) and [Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato](https://jmhl.org)
* [Active Slices for Sliced Stein Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03159.pdf) by [Wenbo Gong](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=wenbo-gong), [Kaibo Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaibo-zhang-2000/?originalSubdomain=uk), [Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/) and [Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato](https://jmhl.org).

The code is implemeneted based on Pytorch 1.6.0.

If you use our code for research, please consider citing the papers.
